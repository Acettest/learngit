and then git checkout -- filename

git branch
watch all the branch

git branch <name>

git checkout <name>

git merge <name>
actually,if the name is the same as the branch you are in,the merge will not do anything.so when merge a branch,you should switch to a branch that is the main branch relative to the branch that will be merged.

git branch -d <name> 
delete a branch that is merged.if the branch is not be merged and you still wanna to delete it, use [git branch -D <name>]
